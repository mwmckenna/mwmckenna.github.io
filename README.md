	<p>about me<br />
		<small> Avid Skier. Passionate Painter. I tried coding for the first time as a senior in college and was surprised at how much fun I had doing it. After graduating from college in 2011,  I worked for a women's apparel start-up where I was occasionally able to use the basic knowledge I learned in my HTML course. When the company closed in 2012, I moved to Jackson Hole where I worked as a Reservations Agent for a vacation rental firm. I have always had a knack for numbers and patterns and I think that I would truly enjoy delving deeper into web development. The idea of creating and improving something that is used on a daily basis strongly appeals to me.</small></p>
